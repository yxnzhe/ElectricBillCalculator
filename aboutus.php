        <h1>Elec Tricks</h1>
        <p>We are students from Taylor's University, Malaysia. We developed Elec Tricks to solve the difficulties in calculating the electric bills for owner and/or tenants to calculate for the electric usages and amount to be paid each months. The special points that makes us stand out from other electric calculate system was that, our system could:</p>
        <ol>
            <ul>- Calculate the total amount to be paid by each rooms based on the electricity bill.</ul>
            <ul>- Calculate the total amount and divide the common area usages equally.</ul>
            <ul>- Add as many users/tenants based on the number of rooms/tenants.</ul>
        </ol>
        <p>This project was developed using PHP, Ajax, JavaScript, Bootstrap, CSS, HTML and we are currently working on implementing self hosted MySQL database into our system.</p>
        <p>Please do not hesitate to reach out to us for any suggestions that could make our system better. <address><a href="mailto: yanzhe2003@gmail.com; donghao20082001@gmail.com?subject=Suggestions for Elec Tricks">Contact Us</a></address></p>
