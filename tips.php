                        Draw up the curtains and open your windows. Most of the time, you won’t even need to switch on your lights till sunset comes round.
                        If you’re afraid of your house getting too hot in the afternoon, you can invest in a translucent thermal curtain to keep the heat out.

                    Not only is it cheaper to buy home appliances with energy-efficient labels, they can even halve your energy consumption at home.
                    For example, an energy-efficient refrigerator uses three times less energy than that of a regular one. LED light bulbs also use 80% less energy than traditional incandescents.

                    We’re not referring to the medical usage of the term here! You’ve surely been nagged to switch off your gadgets and appliances when not in use, but you may not have been asked to unplug them.
                    Did you know that you’re still wasting electricity when you leave your devices plugged in, or on standby mode? In fact, these seemingly trivial actions can account for 12% of your electricity usage.
                    One way to resolve this is to plug your home electronics into power strips. When they’re not in use, simply switch off the power and disconnect the main plug. This helps you save up to 30% on your electricity bill!

                    It’s Malaysia. It’s the land of eternal summer. It’s hot. All. Year. Round. So it’s completely understandable that air-conds are kept on for obscenely long hours! But do yourself a favour and just have it regularly serviced. This will ensure that it’s running efficiently and in turn, your room or home will get colder faster, which means it’ll reduce your electricity use! Tada. Electricity saved.
                    Another way to save electricity and cash is to clean the filter yourself every few months. Cleaning or replacing blocked filters can reduce between 5% and 15% of your energy consumption so go on and YouTube that “how to” video ASAP.

                    his may sound harder than it actually is, to be honest.  Just log on to a shopping website and key in “solar”. There are solar-powered outdoor lights, water pumps for ponds and fountains, string lights and even power banks!
                    But wait, it gets better. If you’re willing to spend a little more and get actual solar panels that can generate electricity… You can sell your collected electricity to the grid to TNB as it’s part of their energy conservation initiative. 
                    For real, this is happening in Malaysia, so put on your schooling hats and get down to doing a little research because this won’t just save electricity or your money – it will make you money: The Feed-In Tariff Malaysia Scheme
